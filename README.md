# Airmed Foundation - Node.js Terminal

Node.js terminal to transfer files through the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). 

The Airmed Foundation is an open source initiative that provides a secure channel to store and transfer medical records. It is based on the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and Hyperledger Fabric. The conjunction of these technologies guarantees the immutability and availability of the data. 

We replicate all records on the IPFS network using the Bittorrent protocol. 
We achieve secure access to files using asymmetric cryptography. 
We protect and store access keys in the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.
